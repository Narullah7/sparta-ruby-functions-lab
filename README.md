# Sparta ruby functions lab

In this folder I used RSpec to tests functions in ruby to check whether they returned the correct value. I displayed this in a neat and presentable way which makes it easy to read.

### Running the tests

Starting at the root directory, and go into the following folder with the following command in the terminal:

```
cd ruby_functions_lab_starter_code/
```
Finally to run the tests, in the terminal:
```
rpsec
```
